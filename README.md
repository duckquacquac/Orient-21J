# Identification of Components of Orient 21J 46931 Movement

## 1. Automatic Winding Module
**Include:** Rotor, Rotor plate, bearing  
**Function:** The unbalanced rotor rotates around the central point when swung. Combined with other mechanisms in the automatic winding module, it winds the spring.  
**Located:** Top of the movement side.

## 4. Gear Train
**Function:** Control and transmit energy from the barrel (e.g., allow the second hand to rotate 1 full circle in 1 minute, etc.)  
**Components:** Main (center) gear, third gear, fourth gear  
**Shared components:** Barrel (also a gear), escape gear (commonly referred to in the escapement module)
